This reei ot microtiim contains materiei

iilustrations (some of which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure thet eii text enci illustrations ere ,
ΙθᾳίῠΙε, exposure settinqs must be changed.
Therefore, when text end illustrations exist

in a sinqie image or when materiei
becquounds differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

Tite first exposure reflects tite camere
operator’s best etfort to capture the majority
oi tite text; the second exposure reiiects the

cernere operator’s bestettort to capture
iliustretive materiei or the remaining text. it

is hoped thet this practice witi resuit irt a
